## Brief Description of the Notebook

### 1. Preprocessing

- **Original Data Processing**: 
  - Loads the dataset using `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`.
  - Prepares training and validation datasets with grayscale images of size (98, 50).
  - Extracts and concatenates images and labels into numpy arrays.
  - Visualizes some examples from the training dataset.

- **Spectrogram Augmentation**:
  - Applies frequency and time masking to the spectrograms.
  - Displays original and augmented spectrograms.
  
- **Spectrogram Mixing**:
  - Mixes spectrograms using the Mixup technique.
  - Displays original and mixed spectrograms.

### 2. Model Building

- **Basic Model**: 
  - Defines a CNN model with specified parameters.
  - Trains the model using different datasets.
  - Evaluates the model on the validation dataset.

### 3. Optimization

- **Grid Search Optimization**:
  - Uses `GridSearchCV` to find the best hyperparameters.
  - Trains the model with the best parameters and evaluates its performance.

- **Bayesian Optimization**:
  - Uses Hyperopt's Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to optimize hyperparameters.
  - Trains and evaluates the model using the best hyperparameters found.
